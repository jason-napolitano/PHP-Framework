# PHP-Framework
> A small, PHP 8, composer-less (although composer is supported) powered micro framework 
> that uses an MVC architecture and services to help delegate relatively proper application 
> flow. Included is a PSR-3 logger, a REST'ful router, a bunch of services and procedural 
> functions to access the core framework and easily interchangeable service components and
> a plethora of exception classes that extend PHP's native `\Exception` SPL's [[view package](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/PHP-Exceptions)].
